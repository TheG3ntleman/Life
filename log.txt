Possible idea to save time and space:
  1. Employ the use of kernals of cells instead of individual cells.
    A sufficiently small kernal size would have a reasonable small
    no. of states and would greatly reduce space used to store the board
    given a sufficiently large board. 

    Furthermore, given a kernal, most of it's cells future state can be
    predicted and stored in memory. I'm guessing that the boundary cells
    are the ones that will pose a problem.
